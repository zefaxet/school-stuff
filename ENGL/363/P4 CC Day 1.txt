Emily - Organic Debunking:
Saying um quite a bit
Talking to screen a lot
Stuck to the right side of the screen - not moving much
Organic vs Conventional slide has a lot of text in bright orange against a white background
	This is completely unreadable and generally just way too much information to try to pack onto a slide
	Did this on a lot of slides including graphic slides
Most eye contact with professor.
Transitioning with "so" a lot
Inflects voice upwards at the end of most phrases and sentences - no relief for listeners
Weak ending

Sam - Electric Grid:
Standing behind desk
Reading from notes a lot
Low volume
Twiddling thumb, Licking lips
Slide theme fits somewhat

Megan - indepdendent pharmacies:
"How many joe's you know" - makes it personal
Transitioning with so a lot - quite a few um's
Planted on right side of screen
Lots of active hand gestures (good probably)

Bullet point slides
Slide theme and imagery fits with topic well
"And these are my references! (shy)"

Lindsay - squirrel saving your brain:
Smooth introduction, draws you in with promise of saving your brain
Gives details like a story
Stumbling over words
Moving around, sweeping eye contact
Continuously posing interesting questions that are meant to poke holes in the audience understanding
Unique conclusion slide.

The proposal that I ranked as number one is the Defensive Driving Course. Even though, I still withheld some of the funding they requested from the final disembursement. I reached this conclusion by reviewing how closely each proposal followed the submission criteria. The Defensive Driving Course proposal is only missing a detailed breakdown of the costs, though they still provide some sensible justification for the requested budget. The other proposals are missing whole sections, which means funding them poses higher risk on the basis of there being too many missing details. The Skyview Coalition proposal does not contain any approach, and the Teen Initiative Plan is missing any explicit mention of impact. The Gameday Brigade proposal is littered with errors and irrelevant information, so it was ranked last and received no funding.
As for my grant proposal, I just went to Google for finding additional sources. Specifically, what I did was I used Google's advanced search functions to filter out results that did not end in ".gov". The publication I ended up sourcing, Risk Analysis 2012, didn't actually come from a ".gov" domain but using this tool from Google is what put me in the right direction. From this source, I looked for information supporting the idea that wearing helmets are beneficial. I The paper included a model indicating a linear relationship between the chance of getting injured on the bicycle and the situational risks associated with not wearing a helmet.
My greatest challenge in doing this assignment was organizing the information in my memo in such a way that it could stay concise. I actually ended up rewriting the memo after near finishing it because it just looked too unorganized and was hard to follow. I spent a hanful of hours on the memo alone, but I think I was able to sufficiently reduce the memo and order the information so that it is a bit easier to follow and provides the important details.

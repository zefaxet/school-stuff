Tech Schell 2.0 By Edward Auttonberry
Created for CSC 345 with Dr. Box

Everything works up to the specifications of the assignment document
Do not press TAB or any arrow keys because I don't capture those and its just gonna make the command line get funky

Use default make task to compile all sources

Tech schell sources (tsh.c) were written wholly by me. Certain portions of this assignment are leftovers from Tech Shell 1.0 completed for CSC 222.

The source files strmap.c and strmap.h are licensed under the GNU LGPL and borrowed from the internet. I do not make claim to these sources.
The source for these files can be found at http://www.pokristensson.com/strmap.html

------------------ USING tsh -------------------
--- all commands are case sensitive
------------------------------------------------

set <id> <value> -- sets a variable and its value
	set example example
	set var_a 123
	set foo bar

list -- displays all shell variables and their values
	The above sets would result in the following output
	example: example
	var_a: 123
	foo: bar

PIPING
	<command> | <command> [| <command ...] : directs output of leftside command to stdin for next command
		echo test | grep t | wc

--- the following are left over from Tech Shell 1.0

pwd -- display current working directory
cd <dir> -- change directory
exit <status> -- exit shell with status code, defaulting to 0

IO REDIRECTION
	<command> > <file> : directs from stdout to a file
		echo foo > example
	<command> < <file>: directs from file to stdin
		cat < example

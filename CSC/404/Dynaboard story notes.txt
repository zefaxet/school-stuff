Need basic signalling "command" functions on client side that set templating for the board.
	The actual interface would wrap these commands so that we can change the interface without
	affecting the templating software.
	
Similarly, the onboard software needs to receive (and maybe render) the character for a key
	separately from actually calculating the display for the character. This is so that we
	can easily swap screens if we eventually need to.

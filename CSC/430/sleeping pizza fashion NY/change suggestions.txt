CHANGES:
	Foreign keys in Review can be reduced to single reference to record in Orders table
	We absolutely do not need Top_Type, Bottom_Type, or Shoe_Type
		We do not make any foreign key references to it
		It contains solely duplicate information
	We probably dont need C_Order because it only contains duplicate information from Orders
	Reduce_Stock_After_Purchase trigger doesnt work, should be update table clause?
